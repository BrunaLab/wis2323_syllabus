# WIS 2323: The Future of Rain Forests

## A UF Quest 2 Course & GenEd Course

This is the teaching materials and website for the UF Quest 2 course "The Future of Tropical Rain Forests". You can [review the syllabus here](https://brunalab.github.io/wis2323_syllabus/). Most of the class sessions work as a 'flipped' or 'active-learning' sessions, with students reading articles and viewing videos before coming to class. Class time is spent discussing the material and working on exercises with the teacher answering questions and demoing the concepts. The course remains under active development and I welcome contributions or suggestions to all aspects of the course and website. Suggestions for exercises, readings, examples, and exercises for a GenEd audience are especially welcome. You are welcome to use course materials for your own course.  The course content and organization is a forkable repository, an act that was inspired by the [Data Carpentry for Biologists](https://github.com/datacarpentry/semester-biology) course developed, taught, and shared by [@ethanwhite](https://github.com/ethanwhite).

### Organizational notes:

The syllabus is a quarto `html` book book the option to download a `pdf`. It is deployed using Github pages and uses Github actions to rerender both the `html` and `pdf` versions where  when changes are pushed to the repository.

### How to contribute to the course or suggest corrections 

1. With the standard GitHub flow: fork the repository, add or change material, and submit a pull request.
2. Send me an [email](mailto:embruna@ufl.edu).


### Up next:
1. As per the [README for EW's Carpentry course](https://github.com/datacarpentry/semester-biology), I will soon be reviewing all materials for accessibility and scanning new pull requests with pa11y and pa11y-ci to ensure that additions to the site follow accessibility best practices. If you discover any accessibility issues with the site please open an issue and I'll address them.
