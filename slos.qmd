(B). \n\n(2)  Distinguish (a) the different ways humans use and alter rain forests, and (b) the social, economic, and biological consequences of these activities. Assessments: In-class activities, Reflective Essay, Final Project. (B, Q2)  \n\n(3)  Explain how genetics, remote sensing, computational tools, and other scientific developments have advanced research on the ecology and evolution of rain forest biota. Assessments: In-class activities, Analytic Essay. (B). \n\n(4)  Examine the historical factors that have shaped cultural perceptions of rain forests. Assessments: In-class activities, Movie Reviews, Final project. (Q2).  \n\n(5)  Analyze how narratives about rain forests are reflected in different types of contemporary cultural expression. Assessments: In-class activities, Movie Reviews, Final project. (Q2).  \n\n(6)  Distinguish between the primary drivers of forest loss and how they vary geographically. Assessments: In-class activities, Analytic Essay. (B, Q2)  \n\n(7)  Critique different proposed mechanisms for rain forest conservation. Assessments: In-class activities, Analytic Essay. (B, Q2)")

Assessments: In-class activities, Analytic Essay  (B, Q2). \n\n(2) Analyze qualitative data on rural-urban migration and human demographic shifts in tropical countries and assess the potential implications of the results for conservation and broader societal issues. Assessments: In-class activities, Analytic Essay (B, Q2). \n\n(3) Explain the relationship between deforestation and the global climate cycle. Compare alternative policy pathways for reducing CO2 emissions using the En-ROADS global climate simulator. Assessments: In-class activities, Reflective Essay (B, Q2).")

Assessments: In-class activities, Analytic Essay, Final Project. \n\n(3) Develop audience-specific content and materials with which to communicate an important issue related to tropical forest biology and conservation.

Assessments: In-class activities, Movie Reviews, Final Project  (Q2). \n\n(2) Assess the feedbacks between (a) the actions of individuals, governments, and the private sector, (b) global economic, social, and political conditions, and (c) the status rain forests and the global climate cycle. Assessments: In-class activities, Reflective Essay, Analytic Essay (Q2). \n\n(3) Appraise the ubiquity of tropical forest products in daily life, the role and impact of the global commodity chains that make this possible, and the consequences of consumer behavior for forest conservation and socioeconomic sustainability. Assessments: In-class activities, Final Project (Q2). \n\n(4) Analyze the local, regional, and global ecosystem services provided by tropical rain forests, how these vary geographically, and some of the cultural and ecological factors responsible for these differences.
