## TEXT 1: [*Utopia*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2130/2130-h/2130-h.htm), Thomas Moore (1516) 

_"Sir Thomas More (1477-1535) was the first person to write of a 'utopia', a
word used to describe a perfect imaginary world. More's book imagines a complex,
self-contained community set on an island, in which people share a common culture
and way of life...It is unclear as to whether the book is a serious projection 
of a better way of life, or a satire that gave More a platform from which to 
discuss the chaos of European politics."

\vspace{0.2cm}

> Under the equator, and as far on both sides of it as the sun moves,
there lay vast deserts that were parched with the perpetual heat of
the sun; the soil was withered, all things looked dismally, and all
places were either quite uninhabited, or abounded with wild beasts and
serpents, and some few men, that were neither less wild nor less cruel
than the beasts themselves. But, as they went farther, a new scene
opened, all things grew milder, the air less burning, the soil more
verdant, and even the beasts were less wild: and, at last, there were
nations, towns, and cities, that had not only mutual commerce among
themselves and with their neighbours, but traded, both by sea and
land, to very remote countries.

## TEXT 2: [*Paradise Lost*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/26/26-h/26-h.htm), John Milton (1667)

_"Milton intended to ‘justify the ways of God to men’ (1.26). 
He begins with Satan, who has been banished to Hell after his revolt against God,
and goes on to explore God’s creation of humankind, the temptation of 
Adam and Eve in Eden, and the concept of sin."
(source: [The British Library](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/john-milton-paradise-lost))_

>So on he fares, and to the border comes\
Of Eden, where delicious Paradise,\
Now nearer, crowns with her enclosure green,\
As with a rural mound, the champaign head\
Of a steep wilderness, whose hairy sides\
With thicket overgrown, grotesque and wild,\
Access denied; and overhead upgrew\
Insuperable height of loftiest shade,\
Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm,\
A sylvan scene, and, as the ranks ascend,\
Shade above shade, a woody theatre\
Of stateliest view. Yet higher than their tops\
The verdurous wall of Paradise upsprung;\
Which to our general sire gave prospect large\
Into his nether empire neighbouring round.\
And higher than that wall a circling row\
Of goodliest trees, loaden with fairest fruit,\
Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue,\
Appeared

## TEXT 3: [*Jungle Book*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/35997/35997-h/35997-h.htm), Rudyard Kipling (1894)

_Kipling (1865–1936) was an English novelist, author of short stories, poet, 
and journalist. In 1907, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. 
He was the first English-language writer to receive this prize and its 
youngest recipient to date (he was 41 yrs old). 
[The Jungle Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle_Book) is a collection 
of fables in which he uses anthropomorphic animals to teach moral lessons._ 
\vspace{0.2cm}

> "Listen, man-cub," said the bear, and his voice rumbled like thunder
on a hot night. "I have taught thee all the Law of the Jungle for all
the Peoples of the Jungle---except the Monkey Folk who live in the
trees. They have no Law. They are outcastes. They have no speech of
their own, but use the stolen words which they overhear when they
listen and peep and wait up above in the branches. Their way is not
our way. They are without leaders. They have no remembrance. They
boast and chatter and pretend that they are a great people about to do
great affairs in the jungle, but the falling of a nut turns their
minds to laughter, and all is forgotten. We of the jungle have no
dealings with them. We do not drink where the monkeys drink; we do not
go where the monkeys go; we do not hunt where they hunt; we do not die
where they die."

## Text 4: *The White Man's Burden*, Rudyard Kipling (1899)

_In this poem Kipling makes clear his perspective on the looming 
Philippine–American War (1899–1902). This is only the first stanza; you 
can read the rest of the poem and about the political background 
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Man%27s_Burden)._
\vspace{0.2cm}

>Take up the White Man's burden\
Send forth the best ye breed\
Go bind your sons to exile\
To serve your captives' need;\
To wait in heavy harness,\
On fluttered folk and wild\
Your new-caught, sullen peoples,\
Half-devil and half-child

## TEXT 5: [*Heart of Darkness*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/219/219-h/219-h.htm), Joseph Conrad (1899)

_Conrad (born Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski, 1857-1924) is regarded as 
one of the greatest novelists to write in the English language. His writings 
depict trials of the human spirit in the midst of what he saw as an impassive, 
inscrutable universe. In 1890 he spent time in what was then the known as the 
[Congo Free State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State) 
(which was actually a privately owned colony of Leopold II of Belgium). 
The things he saw and experienced there would inspire 
his novella _Heart of Darkness_._ 
\vspace{0.2cm}

> It was just two months from the day we left the creek when we came to
the bank below Kurtz's station. Going up that river was like traveling
back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted
on the earth and the big trees were kings. An empty stream, a great
silence, an impenetrable forest. The air was warm, thick, heavy,
sluggish. There was no joy in the brilliance of sunshine. The long
stretches of the waterway ran on, deserted, into the gloom of
overshadowed distances...The broadening waters flowed through a mob of
wooded islands; you lost your way on that river as you would in a
desert, and butted all day long against shoals, trying to find the
channel, till you thought yourself bewitched and cut off for ever from
everything you had known once somewhere far away --- in another
existence perhaps. There were moments when one's past came back to
one, as it will sometimes when you have not a moment to spare for
yourself; but it came in the shape of an unrestful and noisy dream,
remembered with wonder amongst the overwhelming realities of this
strange world of plants, and water, and silence. And this stillness of
life did not in the least resemble a peace. It was the stillness of an
implacable force brooding over an inscrutable intention. It looked at
you with a vengeful aspect...

>...I tried to break the spell---the heavy, mute spell of the
wilderness that seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast by the
awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts, by the memory of
gratified and monstrous passions.

## TEXT 6: [*Cabbages and Kings*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2777/2777-h/2777-h.htm), O. Henry (1905)

_O. Henry was the pen name of William Sydney Porter (1862–1910), an American 
writer known primarily for his short stories (e.g., "The Gift of the Magi"). 
The novel _Cabbages and Kings_ is comprises interlinked short stories set in 
the fictitional Central American country of "The Republic of Anchuria". 
It was inspired by O. Henry's experiences in Honduras in the late 1890s._
\vspace{0.2cm}

> Well, then, in three days we sailed alongside that Guatemala...We
landed at a town on the coast, where a train of cars was waitin' for
us on a dinky little railroad.....We run some forty miles in seven
hours, and the train stopped. There was no more railroad. 'Twas a sort
of camp in a damp gorge full of wildness and melancholies. They was
gradin' and choppin' out the forests ahead to continue the road.
'Here,' says I to myself, 'is the romantic haunt of the
revolutionists. Here will Clancy, by the virtue that is in a superior
race and the inculcation of Fenian tactics, strike a tremendous blow
for liberty. The trees was all sky-scrapers; the underbrush was full
of needles and pins; there was monkeys jumpin' around and crocodiles
and pink-tailed mockin'-birds, and ye stood knee-deep in the rotten
water and grabbled roots for the liberation of Guatemala. Of nights we
would build smudges in camp to discourage the mosquitoes, and sit in
the smoke, with the guards pacin' all around us.

> One old man named Halloran --- a man of Hibernian entitlements and
discretions, explained it to me. He had been workin' on the road a
year. Most of them died in less than six months. He was dried up to
gristle and bone, and shook with chills every third night. "Ye're
surrounded by a ragin' forest full of disreputable beasts---lions and
baboons and anacondas---waitin' to devour ye. The sun strikes ye hard,
and melts the marrow in your bones...The fault's wid these tropics.
They rejuices a man's system. 'Tis a land, as the poet says, 'Where it
always seems to be after dinner'."

## TEXT 7: *Beyond the Chagres River*, James S Gilbert (1905)  

_The Chagres River is in central Panama. It is the largest river in the Panama 
Canal's watershed and is dammed twice. The resulting reservoirs — Gatun Lake 
and Lake Alajuela — form an integral part of the Panama Canal and 
its water system._
\vspace{0.2cm}

>Beyond the Chagres River,\
'Tis said (the story's old),\
Are paths that lead to mountains\
Of purest virgin gold;\
But 'tis my firm conviction\
Whate'er the tales they tell\
Beyond the Chagres River\
All paths lead straight to Hell.

## TEXT 8: [*Tarzan of the Apes*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/78/78-h/78-h.htm), Edgar Rice Burroughs (1912)

_Burroughs (1875–1950) was an American author of adventure, science fiction, 
and fantasy stories; his most well-known characters are Tarzan and John Carter. 
Tarzan (aka John Clayton II, Viscount Greystoke) was a 'feral child raised in 
the African jungle by the Mangani great apes; he later experiences civilization,
only to reject it and return to the wild as a heroic adventurer'
(source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarzan))_

\vspace{0.2cm}

>Their work done the sailors returned to the small boat, and pulled off
rapidly toward the Arrow. Tarzan, an interested spectator of all that
had taken place, sat speculating on the strange actions of these
peculiar creatures. Men were indeed more foolish and more cruel than
the beasts of the jungle! How fortunate was he who lived in the peace
and security of the great forest!

## TEXT 9: *One Hundred Years of Solitude*, Gabriel García Márquez (1967)
_This novel by Colombian author and Nobel Laureate Gabriel García Márquez
tells the story of multiple generations of the Buendía family, 
whose patriarch founded the fictitious town of Macondo._
<!-- \vspace{0.2cm} -->

>Then, for more than ten days, they did not see the sun again. The
ground became soft and damp, like volcanic ash, and the vegetation was
thicker and thicker, and the cries of the birds and the uproar of the
monkeys became more and more remote, and the world became eternally
sad. The men on the expedition felt overwhelmed by their most ancient
memories in that paradise of dampness and silence, going back to
before original sin, as their boots sank into pools of steaming oil
and their machetes destroyed bloody lilies and golden salamanders.

\vspace{0.5cm}
## TEXT 10: *Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia*, Elizabeth Gilbert (2006)
_This memoir by American Elizabeth Gilbert chronicles her trip around 
the world following her divorce and the resulting personal discoveries. 
It was an international best-seller (e.g., 187 weeks on the NYTimes list)._
\vspace{0.2cm}

>So I take a taxi to the town of Ubud, which seems like a good place to
start my journey. I check into a small and pretty hotel there on the
fabulously named Monkey Forest Road. The hotel has a sweet swimming
pool and a garden crammed with tropical flowers with blossoms bigger
than volleyballs (tended to by a highly organized team of hummingbirds
and butterflies). The staff is Balinese, which means they
automatically start adoring you and complimenting you on your beauty
as soon as you walk in. The room has a view of the tropical treetops
and there's a breakfast included every morning with piles of fresh
tropical fruit. In short, it's one of the nicest places I've ever
stayed and it's costing me less than ten dollars a day. It's good to
be back.

>The sound universe is also spectacular around here. In the evenings
there's a cricket orchestra with frogs providing the bass line. In the
dead of night the dogs howl about how misunderstood they are. Before
dawn the roosters for miles around announce how freaking cool it is to
be roosters. ("We are ROOSTERS!" they holler. "We are the only ones
who get to be ROOSTERS!") Every morning around sunrise there is a
tropical birdsong competition, and it's always a ten-way tie for the
championship. When the sun comes out the place quiets down and the
butterflies get to work. The whole house is covered with vines; I feel
like any day it will disappear into the foliage completely and I will
disappear with it and become a jungle flower myself. The rent is less
than what I used to pay in New York City for taxi fare every month.

>I rode my bicycle back home, pushing my happy body up the hills toward
my house in the late afternoon sun. On my way through the forest, a
big male monkey dropped out of a tree right in front of me and bared
his fangs at me. I didn't even flinch. I said, "Back off, Jack---I got
four brothers protecting my ass," and I just rode right on by him^1^.

> ^1^_Two primate species are found on Bali: the [Crab-Eating Macaque, _Macaca fascicularis_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab-eating_macaque) and the 
[Javan Langur, _Trachypithecus auratus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Javan_langur). 
This was alost certainly a Macaque, which is is known for stealing cameras, 
sunglasses, and other items from tourists and refusing to give them back 
until they are given some food._
