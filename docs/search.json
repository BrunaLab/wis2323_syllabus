    "text": "Learning in our class is achieved with an diverse array of methods ranging from data analysis to essays to projects. In most class sessions you will also be working with small groups of students to complete an in-class assignment that reinforces the major themes of the day’s topic. In keeping with the philosophy of the Quest program, this course also has Experiential Learning and Self-Reflection Components. For details on the different types of assignments and the Quest Learning Components, see the course Canvas page.\n\n5.0.1 Assignments (1000 points total)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.2 Grading\nIn-class Assignments are due by the following class session. Late assignments will lose 10 pts.\nRegrades: Requests for re-evaluation of assignments must be accompanied by an explanation for why you think you deserve additional credit and the number of additional points you think you deserve. The deadline for submission is one week after the work was returned.\nGrade Assignment (based on % of total points earned): A = 94–100%, A- = 90–93%, B+ = 87–89%, B = 84–86%, B- = 80–83%, C+ = 77–79%, C = 74–76%, C- = 70–73%, D+ = 67–69%, D = 64–66%, D- = 60–63%, E&lt;60\nGrade Points: For information on how UF assigns grade points, visit: https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-regulations/grades-grading-policies/\n\n\n5.0.3 Attendance & Participation\nAttendance: Though attendance is not required, many of the sessions we will be completing activities in class that count towards your grade. Most of these can be completed independently, but by doing them in class you will benefit from working collaboratively with the other students.\nSome of the in-class activities can only be completed in that day’s class session. If you miss class on one one of these days, that is why the grade for in-class activities is based on a subset of the total activities; you can also elect to make up lost points with extra-credit assignments. If you need to miss class for any reason, please let me know as soon as possible. We will make arrangements for you to complete any assignments and go over any material you will be missing. I would much rather you focus on your health, attend your conference, or support friends and family in need than struggle to turn in assignments.\nParticipation: Consistent informed, thoughtful, and considerate class participation is encouraged (and in some cases required). If you have personal issues that prohibit you from joining freely in class discussion (e.g., shyness, language barriers, medical condition): no problem. let us know and we will discuss alternative modes of participation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant note regarding class discussions and group work.\n\n\n\nWe will explore some challenging, important problems and increase our understandings of different perspectives and approaches for addressing them. These conversations may not always be easy; we sometimes will make mistakes in both how we communicate our perspective and what we hear other say. There may be times when we need patience, courage, imagination, and of course mutual respect to engage our texts, classmates, instructors, guests, and our own ideas and experiences. Disrespectful or disruptive behavior will not be tolerated. And always remember that as scholars we must employ critical thinking, rely on data, and cite verifiable sources and experts to interrogate all assigned readings and subject matter in this course as a means of determining if we agree with classmates and instructors. No lesson is intended to espouse, promote, advance, inculcate, or compel a particular feeling, perception, viewpoint or belief.",

Please share your letter with me and discuss access needs as early as possible in the semester so that I can do whatever is necessary to ensure your participation and learning.\n\n\nCourse Evaluations\nStudents are expected to provide professional and respectful feedback on the quality of instruction in this course by completing course evaluations. Guidance on how to provide constructive feedback is available at https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/. Students will be notified when the evaluation period opens. Summaries of course evaluation results are available to students at https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/. Students can complete evaluations in three ways: (1) The email they receive from GatorEvals, (2) Their Canvas course menu under GatorEvals, and (3) The central portal at https://my-ufl.bluera.com.\n\n\nUniversity Honesty Policy\nUF students are bound by The Honor Pledge which states, “We, the members of the University of Florida community, pledge to hold ourselves and our peers to the highest standards of honor and integrity by abiding by the Honor Code. On all work submitted for credit by students at the University of Florida, the following pledge is either required or implied: On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid in doing this assignment. The Honor Code (https://www.dso.ufl.edu/sccr/process/student-conduct-honor-code) specifies a number of behaviors that are in violation of this code and the possible sanctions. Furthermore, you are obligated to report any condition that facilitates academic misconduct to appropriate personnel. If you have questions or concerns, consult with the instructor or TAs.\n\n\nSoftware Use\nAll faculty, staff & students are required & expected to obey laws and legal agreements governing software use. Failure to do so can lead to monetary damages and/or criminal penalties for the individual violator. Because such violations are also against UF policies & rules, disciplinary action will be taken as appropriate.\n\n\nAttendance\nRequirements for class attendance & make-up exams, assignments, and other work are consistent with UF policies found at: https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/regulations/info/attendance.aspx.\n\n\nIn-Class Recording\nStudents are allowed to record video or audio of class lectures. However, the purposes for which these recordings may be used are strictly controlled. The only allowable purposes are: (1)for personal educational use, (2)in connection with a complaint to the university, or (3)as evidence in, or in preparation for, a criminal or civil proceeding. All other purposes are prohibited.Specifically, students may not publish recorded lectures without the written consent of the instructor. A 'class lecture' is:an educational presentation intended to inform or teach enrolled students about a particular subject, including any instructor-led discussions that form part of the presentation, and delivered by any instructor hired or appointed by the University, or by a guest instructor, as part of a UF course. A class lecture does not include:lab sessions, student presentations, clinical presentations such as patient history, academic exercises involving solely student participation, assessments (quizzes, tests, exams), field trips, private conversations between students in the class or between a student and the faculty or lecturer during a class session. Publication without permission of the instructor is prohibited. To 'publish' means: to share, transmit, circulate, distribute, or provide access to a recording, regardless of format or medium, to another person (or persons), including but not limited to another student within the same class section. Additionally, a recording, or transcript of a recording, is considered published if it is posted on or uploaded to, in whole or in part, any media platform, including but not limited to social media, book, magazine, newspaper, leaflet, or third-party note/tutoring services. A student who publishes a recording without written consent may be subject to a civil cause of action instituted by a person injured by the publication and/or discipline under UF Regulation 4.040 Student Honor Code and Student Conduct Code.",
