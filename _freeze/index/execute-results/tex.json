In most class sessions you will also be working with small groups of students to complete an in-class assignment that reinforces the major themes of the day's topic. In keeping with the philosophy of the Quest program, this course also has *Experiential Learning and Self-Reflection Components*. \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Important note regarding class discussions & group work.\n\nWe will explore some challenging, important problems and increase our understandings of different perspectives and approaches for addressing them. These conversations may not always be easy; we sometimes will make mistakes in both how we communicate our perspective and what we hear other say. There may be times when we need patience, courage, imagination, and of course mutual respect to engage our texts, classmates, instructors, guests, and our own ideas and experiences. *Disrespectful or disruptive behavior will not be tolerated*. And always remember that as scholars we rely on critical thinking, data, prior scholarship, and expert opinion when interrogating assigned readings and discussing course content with classmates and instructors.\n:::\n\n### Assignments (1000 pts) {.unnumbered} \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/hw.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Grading {.unnumbered} \n\n**In-class Assignments are due by the following class session.** Late assignments will lose 10 pts.\n\n***Regrades:*** Requests for re-evaluation of assignments must be accompanied by an explanation for why you think you deserve additional credit and the number of additional points you think you deserve.

Most of these can be completed independently, but by doing them in class you will benefit from working collaboratively with the other students.\n\n**Some of the in-class activities can only be completed in that day's class session.** If you miss class on one one of these days, that is why the grade for in-class activities is based on a subset of the total activities; you can also elect to make up lost points with extra-credit assignments. **_If you need to miss class for any reason, please let me know as soon as possible_**. We will make arrangements for you to complete any assignments and go over any material you will be missing. I would much rather you focus on your health, attend your conference, or support friends and family in need than struggle to turn in assignments.\n\n### Participation {.unnumbered} \n\nConsistent informed, thoughtful, and considerate class participation is encouraged (and in some cases required). *If you have personal issues that prohibit you from joining freely in class discussion (e.g., shyness, language barriers, medical condition): no problem.* let us know and we will discuss alternative modes of participation.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Calendar & Key Dates  \n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\\fontsize{9}{11}\\selectfont\n\n\\begin{longtable}[l]{>{}c>{\\centering\\arraybackslash}p{7em}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{30em}>{}r}\n\\toprule\n\\cellcolor[HTML]{1F691B}{\\textcolor{white}{\\textbf{WEEK}}} & \\cellcolor[HTML]{1F691B}{\\textcolor{white}{\\textbf{DATE}}} & \\cellcolor[HTML]{1F691B}{\\textcolor{white}{\\textbf{TOPIC}}} & \\cellcolor[HTML]{1F691B}{\\textcolor{white}{\\textbf{ASSIGNMENT INFO}}}\\\\\n\\midrule\n\\addlinespace[0.3em]\n\\multicolumn{4}{l}{\\textbf{WHY ARE WE FASCINATED BY TROPICAL RAIN FORESTS?}}\\\\\n\\textbf{\\hspace{1em}Week 1} & 19-Aug & Class Starts Thursday! & \\textbf{}\\\\\n\\textbf{\\hspace{1em}} & 21-Aug & Course Welcome and Introduction & \\textbf{}\\\\\n\\midrule\\\\\n\\textbf{\\hspace{1em}Week 2} & 26-Aug & Historical Narratives & \\textbf{}\\\\\n\\textbf{\\hspace{1em}} & 28-Aug & Rain forest imagery in art \\& lit & \\textbf{}\\\\\n\\midrule\n\\textbf{\\hspace{1em}Week 3} & 2-Sep & The Rain Forest in pop culture & \\textbf{Movie Reviews Assigned}\\\\\n\\textbf{\\hspace{1em}} & 4-Sep & What is a Rain Forest?

{.unnumbered}\nSend a message in CANVAS. That way both the TA and instructor will see it and you will get a response more quickly. Plus emails sent to us directly tend to get buried under other messages. \n\n<!-- <span style=\"color: #1F691B;\"> {{< fa bullhorn >}} </span> -->\n##### How will you send class announcements? {.unnumbered} \nCANVAS. Check the course page for announcements and be sure you are receiving Canvas emails and updates.\n\n<!-- <span style=\"color: #1F691B;\"> {{< fa house-user >}} </span> -->\n##### What work should we complete BEFORE class? {.unnumbered} \nRead, watch, listen to, or review all materials assigned for the session. This material sets the stage for in-class activities.\n\n<!-- <span style=\"color: #1F691B;\"> {{< fa person-chalkboard >}} </span> -->\n##### What will we do DURING class? {.unnumbered} \nIn-class exercises that reinforce key concepts, discussions of the assigned readings, and let you practice skills in other assignments. Some are completed individually, while others require working in groups or pairs. Each activity will have instructions and a rubric; most are designed to be finished in class.  \n\n<!-- <span style=\"color: #1F691B;\"> {{< fa volume-xmark >}} </span> -->\n##### When is the \"in-class\" work due? {.unnumbered} \nDeadlines are in Canvas, but typically the start of the next class session.\n\n<!-- <span style=\"color: #1F691B;\"> {{< fa calendar-check >}} </span> -->\n##### What if I miss class? {.unnumbered} \nAttendance is not required, but in many of the sessions we will be completing activities in class that count towards your grade. Most of these can be completed independently, but by doing them in class you will benefit from working collaboratively with the other students. Some of the in-class activities, however, can not be completed on your own. That's why only a subset of the in-class assignments count towards your grade and we offer extra credit.\n\n<!-- <span style=\"color: #1F691B;\"> {{< fa calendar-xmark >}} </span> -->\n##### I have to miss class on a certain date. What should I do? {.unnumbered} \n\nLet us know as soon as possible so we can make arrangements for you to review material you will miss and complete assignments.\")\n\n<!-- <span style=\"color: #1F691B;\"> {{< fa calendar-plus >}} </span> -->\n##### Class discussions are difficult for me. Will this affect my grade? {.unnumbered} \n\nNo! If there are issues that make engaging in discussions difficult (e.g., shyness, language barriers, a medical condition), let us know and we will find alternative modes of participation.\n\n<!-- ## {{< fa person-breastfeeding >}}{.unnumbered} -->\n\n<!-- <span style=\"color: #1F691B;\"> {{< fa person-breastfeeding >}} </span>  -->\n\n##### I unexpectedly have no child care today...what can I do? {.unnumbered}\nUF does not have a policy on children in the classroom, so here is mine: I never want students to feel they have to choose between their responsibilities as parents and their education. Bringing your child to class because of a gap in child care is totally fine (and that includes babies). If you do so, please try and sit close to the exit so that you can more easily step outside if you need to care for them and so other students can continue learning.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n<!-- # University Policies {.unnumbered} -->\n# UF Policies\n\n<!-- <span style=\"color: #1F691B;\"> {{< fa headphones >}} </span>  -->\n### Student Accomodations  {.unnumbered} \nStudents with disabilities or learning barriers that would like to request academic accommodations should connect with the Disability Resource Center by visiting [https://disability.ufl.edu/students/get-started/](https://disability.ufl.edu/students/get-started/).
