On all work submitted for credit by students at the University of Florida, the following pledge is either required or implied: On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid in doing this assignment. The Honor Code (https://www.dso.ufl.edu/sccr/process/student-conduct-honor-code) specifies a number of behaviors that are in violation of this code and the possible sanctions. Furthermore, you are obligated to report any condition that facilitates academic misconduct to appropriate personnel. If you have questions or concerns, consult with the instructor or TAs. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;width: 10em; font-weight: bold;color: rgba(31, 105, 27, 255) !important;background-color: white !important;\"> Software Use </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 35em; color: black !important;background-color: white !important;\"> All faculty, staff  &amp; students are required  &amp; expected to obey laws and legal agreements governing software use.

However, the purposes for which these recordings may be used are strictly controlled. The only allowable purposes are: (1)for personal educational use, (2)in connection with a complaint to the university, or (3)as evidence in, or in preparation for, a criminal or civil proceeding. All other purposes are prohibited.Specifically, students may not publish recorded lectures without the written consent of the instructor. A 'class lecture' is:an educational presentation intended to inform or teach enrolled students about a particular subject, including any instructor-led discussions that form part of the presentation, and delivered by any instructor hired or appointed by the University, or by a guest instructor, as part of a UF course. A class lecture does not include:lab sessions, student presentations, clinical presentations such as patient history, academic exercises involving solely student participation, assessments (quizzes, tests, exams), field trips, private conversations between students in the class or between a student and the faculty or lecturer during a class session. Publication without permission of the instructor is prohibited. To 'publish' means: to share, transmit, circulate, distribute, or provide access to a recording, regardless of format or medium, to another person (or persons), including but not limited to another student within the same class section. Additionally, a recording, or transcript of a recording, is considered published if it is posted on or uploaded to, in whole or in part, any media platform, including but not limited to social media, book, magazine, newspaper, leaflet, or third-party note/tutoring services. A student who publishes a recording without written consent may be subject to a civil cause of action instituted by a person injured by the publication and/or discipline under UF Regulation 4.040 Student Honor Code and Student Conduct Code. </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n<!-- {{< fa thumbs-up >}}  -->",
